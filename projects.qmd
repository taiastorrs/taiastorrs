## Sustainability and Water Science Projects

### Center for Participatory Science Development
**Colorado State University | Spring 2025**

Collaborated with stakeholder CitSci to design systems 
for CSU's upcoming Center for Participatory Science:

- Wrote a background paper highlighting barriers and 
strategies for inclusive research
- Built a participant database using Airtable and Fillout
- Implemented communication systems via Teams, 
Outlook/Gmail, and Calendly

### Statistical Comparison of Sea Ice and Global Sea Level
**Spring 2024**

Conducted statistical analyses in RStudio to quantify 
correlations between sea ice extent and global sea level 
rise:

- Merged and cleaned satellite-derived datasets
- Ran correlation tests (Pearson's r = -0.48) and 
visualized spatial/temporal trends
- Presented findings demonstrating a significant negative 
correlation between polar ice melt and global sea level 
rise

### Longs Peak Hydrography and Road Map
**Fall 2023**

- Applied ArcGIS to integrate hydrology and transportation datasets
- Created a map of Longs Peak's hydrography and road 
networks to demonstrate spatial data visualization skills

## Field Experience

### Natural Resource Ecology & Measurement
**Colorado State University – Mountain Campus | Summer 
2024**

- Identified 120 different plant and animal species of 
Northern Colorado Region
- Assessed mountain  shrub, ponderosa pine/aspen, lodgepole pine, 
spruce-fir, and alpine ecosystems
- Collected recreation, watershed, range, wildlife, and forestry data using 
quadrants, line-intercepts, transects, and point-centered quarters
- Generated written reports for each ecosystem assessed

### Limnology Field Work
**Colorado State University | Fall 2024**

- Collected depth profiles: temperature, DO content, pH, water chemistry, 
and algae/zooplankton sampling
- Utilized Van Dorn bottles, Sonde, and macroinvertebrate nets for sampling

### Snow Hydrology Field Work
**Colorado State University | Fall 2024**

- Collected snowpack data at Cameron Pass via core samples
- Analyzed Joe Wright SNOTEL station data
