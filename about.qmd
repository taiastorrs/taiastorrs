## About Me

I recently graduated from Colorado State University with 
a Bachelor of Science in Ecosystem Science and 
Sustainability, completing my degree in three years with 
a minor in Watershed Science. This fall, I began pursuing 
a Professional Science Master's in Water Resources 
through CSU's Accelerated Master's Program in ESS.

My academic and professional interests center on 
sustainable water solutions for addressing water scarcity 
in the Western United States. Through my coursework and 
field experience, I've developed a strong passion for 
water resource management and environmental 
sustainability. I'm excited to continue building the 
technical, interdisciplinary, and collaborative skills 
needed to contribute to resilient water systems in the 
face of climate change.

I am dedicated to creating sustainable improvements in 
the water sector, with the aim of contributing my 
expertise to sustainable water management within urban 
settings.
